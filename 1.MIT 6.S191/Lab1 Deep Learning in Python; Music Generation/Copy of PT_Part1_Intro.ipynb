Layers implement common neural networks operations. In PyTorch, when we implement a layer, we subclass `nn.Module` and define the parameters of the layer as attributes of our new class. We also define and override a function [``forward``](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module.forward), which will define the forward pass computation that is performed at every step. All classes subclassing `nn.Module` should override the `forward` function.\n","\n","Let's write a dense layer class to implement a perceptron defined above."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"id":"HutbJk-1kHPh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745205540461,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":95,"user":{"displayName":"yuanhao zheng","userId":"03409576746815847370"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["### Defining a dense layer ###\n","\n","# num_inputs: number of input nodes\n","# num_outputs: number of output nodes\n","# x: input to the layer\n","\n","class OurDenseLayer(torch.nn.Module):\n","    def __init__(self, num_inputs, num_outputs):\n","        super(OurDenseLayer, self).__init__()\n","        # Define and initialize parameters: a weight matrix W and bias b\n","        # Note that the parameter initialize is random!\n","        self.W = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_inputs, num_outputs))\n","        self.bias = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_outputs))\n","\n","    def forward(self, x):\n","        '''TODO: define the operation for z (hint: use torch.matmul).'''\n","        z = torch.add(torch.matmul(x, self.W), self.bias)# TODO\n","\n","        '''TODO: define the operation for out (hint: use torch.sigmoid).'''\n","        y = torch.sigmoid(z)# TODO\n","        return y\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GqeEbn959hV_"},"source":["Now, let's test the output of our layer."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"id":"2yxjCPa69hV_","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745205542897,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":146,"user":{"displayName":"yuanhao zheng","userId":"03409576746815847370"}},"outputId":"5021023a-3b4c-4fc0-ebd0-fbb4eaeaaab3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["input shape: torch.Size([1, 2])\n","output shape: torch.Size([1, 3])\n","output result: tensor([[0.8347, 0.8495, 0.7203]], grad_fn=<SigmoidBackward0>)\n"]}],"source":["# Define a layer and test the output!\n","num_inputs = 2\n","num_outputs = 3\n","layer = OurDenseLayer(num_inputs, num_outputs)\n","x_input = torch.tensor([[1, 2.]])\n","y = layer(x_input)\n","\n","print(f\"input shape: {x_input.shape}\")\n","print(f\"output shape: {y.shape}\")\n","print(f\"output result: {y}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Jt1FgM7qYZ3D"},"source":["Conveniently, PyTorch has defined a number of ```nn.Modules``` (or Layers) that are commonly used in neural networks, for example a [```nn.Linear```](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) or [`nn.Sigmoid`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sigmoid.html) module.\n","\n","Now, instead of using a single ```Module``` to define our simple neural network, we'll use the  [`nn.Sequential`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html) module from PyTorch and a single [`nn.Linear` ](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) layer to define our network.
