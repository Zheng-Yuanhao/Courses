The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs. Modern language models typically use subword tokenization as it balances vocabulary size and sequence length while handling unknown words effectively by breaking them into known subword units.\n","\n","In this lab we will use the tokenizer from the Gemma 2B model, which uses BPE.

You will use this to define a custom metric that uses the judge LLM to evaluate text for how well it adheres to Yoda speak. Note that the judge LLM and the metric can be applied to any text, not just the outputs of the model. This is important to keep in mind, since we need both a negative control -- text in the \"base\" standard English style -- and a positive control -- training-set text in Yoda-speak style -- against which to compare the model's generations.\n","\n","Set the judging criteria in the system prompt, and define the `score` function to evaluate text by querying the judge LLM."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":36,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":249,"status":"ok","timestamp":1745739745938,"user":{"displayName":"yuanhao zheng","userId":"03409576746815847370"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"llB3FgiwBvnJ"},"outputs":[],"source":["from opik.evaluation.metrics import base_metric, score_result\n","\n","class LLMJudgeEvaluator(base_metric.BaseMetric):\n","    def __init__(self, judge: mdl.lab3.LLMClient = None, system_prompt: str = None):\n","        self.judge = judge\n","        self.system_prompt = system_prompt\n","        self.prompt_template = \"Evaluate this text: {text}\"\n","\n","    def score(self, text: str, n_tries=20, **kwargs):\n","        \"\"\" Evaluate by asking an LLM to score it. \"\"\"\n","\n","        for attempt in range(n_tries):\n","            try:\n","                # TODO: Convert the text to template form before passing it to the judge LLM\n","                prompt = self.prompt_template.format(text=text) # TODO\n","\n","                # The system prompt asks the judge to output a JSON dictionary of the form:\n","                # {\"score\": \u003cscore between 0 and 10\u003e}\n","                # To do this, we need to specify the judge to stop generating after it\n","                # closes the JSON dictionary (i.e., when it outputs \"}\")\n","                # Hint: Use the stop=[\"}\"] argument within the judge.ask() method to specify this.\n","                stop = \"}\"\n","\n","                # TODO: Call the judge LLM with the system prompt and the prompt template.\n","                # Remember to stop the generation when the judge LLM outputs \"}\".\n","                res = self.judge.ask(\n","                  system=self.system_prompt,\n","                  user=prompt,\n","                  max_tokens=64,\n","                  stop=[stop]\n","                ) # TODO\n","\n","                # Extract the assistant's content from the API response\n","                # Remember to add the stop character back to the end of the response to be a\n","                # valid JSON dictionary (its not there  the judge LLM stoped once it saw it)\n","                res = res.choices[0].message.content + stop\n","                res_dict = json.loads(res)\n","\n","                max_score = 10 # The maximum score that the LLM should output\n","                score = res_dict[\"score\"] / max_score # Normalize\n","                score = max(0.0, min(score, 1.0)) # Clip between 0 and 1\n","\n","                # Return the score object\n","                return score_result.ScoreResult(name=\"StyleScore\", value=score)\n","\n","            except Exception as e:\n","                if attempt == n_tries - 1:  # Last attempt\n","                    raise e  # Re-raise the exception if all attempts failed\n","                continue  # Try again if not the last attempt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"f5AmxmX07xpO"},"source":["Instaniate your Comet Opik judge using the LLMJudgeEvaluator class and system prompt."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":37,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":248,"status":"ok","timestamp":1745739749169,"user":{"displayName":"yuanhao zheng","userId":"03409576746815847370"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"rrIlh_xW7xpO"},"outputs":[],"source":["judge = LLMJudgeEvaluator(llm, system_prompt=system_prompt)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X1qhxdlg7xpP"},"source":["## 2.4: Evaluating the model by scoring with your judge LLM\n","\n","Now we can use the judge LLM to score the outputs of the model.
