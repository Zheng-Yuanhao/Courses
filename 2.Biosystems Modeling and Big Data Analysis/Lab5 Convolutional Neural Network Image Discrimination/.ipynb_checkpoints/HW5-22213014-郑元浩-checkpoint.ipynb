    "# 实验5 利用卷积神经网络进行穴盘苗是否出苗的图像判别\n",
    "郑元浩-22213014\n",
    "说明：本实验代码为Chat GPT工具辅助完成\n",
    "\n",
    "数据集：包含穴盘苗出苗判别样本共计 1200 个，以及是否出苗的标签值。根据已经划分好的数据集，使用 Training set 训练一个深度卷积神经网络，并在 Test set 上测试，尽可能使得模型精度更高。\n",
    "\n",
    "问题：\n",
    "1、记录至少 20 组不同的超参数组合（列表），对模型结果的影响；\n",
    "答：如最终输出结果所示\n",
    "2、目前模型精度达到最优了么？是否有过拟合的倾向？\n",
    "答：模型精度最优为R2_test=0.99，通过控制Epoch的长度可以控制网络层数，避免过拟合。\n",
    "3、重复训练相同超参数条件下的模型，得到的预测精度相同吗？若不同，尝试解释引起这种变化的原因；\n",
    "答：重复训练相同超参数的模型，预测精度并不同。原因可能为①不同的模型初始状态产生不同的路径和结果；②数据shuffle导致数据顺序不同；\n",
    "为了减小这种变化可以采取的措施：①设置随机种子以确保模型的权重初始化和数据加载的随机过程是可重现的；②通过添加正则化项以限制模型的复杂性；③保存多个训练过程中的模型结果，并在测试时对它们进行平均。\n",
    "4、你认为在该例子中，哪些策略的引入对模型训练的帮助（精度提升）较大？哪些超参数的变化对模型精度影响较大。\n",
    "结果显示Learning Rate为0.001时模型训练效果较好，而Learning Rate=0.01时模型R2_test结果均为0.5，Learning Rate对模型精度的影响最大。"
